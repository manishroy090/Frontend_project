                <p class="parafst"> France is a wonderfully scenic country. It’s full of beautiful lakes and rivers, over
                    which cross many different bridges. Bridges in France come in all shapes and sizes, from ancient
                    aqueducts and stunning arch bridges to masterful viaducts.
                    These impressive European landmarks are a true sight to behold and reveal an aspect of the country’s
                    history you might not be familiar with. Some have been standing since Roman times, while others were
                    only built in the last few centuries.
    
                    All are special in their own way and will make a fabulous addition to any travel itinerary. Without
                    further ado, here are the most unique and beautiful bridges in France.
    
                    Pont Neuf is the oldest standing bridge that runs over the Seine River in Paris. The first stone of the
                    bridge was laid by Henry III in 1578. However, it wasn’t until 1604 that it was open to traffic, and not
                    until 1607 that it was inaugurated by Henry IV.
    
                    Like most bridges built during that time, it followed Roman precedents. It was constructed as a series
                    of short arch bridges and made using stone. Over the years, it has gone through many repairs and
                    renovations, including a major restoration project that took place from 1994 to 2007.
    
                    Pont Ambroix is a 1st century BC Roman bridge in Villetelle, France. Originally, it contained 11 arches,
                    however, today, only one remains. The last arch was carried away by a flood in 1933.
    
                    The bridge has all but completely succumbed to 2000 years of erosion. Although, it’s still a sight of
                    great beauty. It sits in the middle of the Vidourle River and proudly displays the vestiges of the
                    ancient Roman empire. It’s a lovely place for a scenic waterside stroll.</p>

                    Pont d’Avignon is a beautiful medieval bridge in the town of Avignon, France. From 1177 to 1185, a
                    wooden bridge was constructed where the present structure stands. This early bridge only stood for 40
                    years; it was destroyed during the Albigensian Crusade in 1226.
    
                    The bridge was rebuilt in 1234 and contained 22 stone arches. However, it met a sad fate again In 1663,
                    when the structure was abandoned. It proved too expensive to maintain, as the arches often collapsed
                    each time the river flooded.
                    Pont Alexandre III is a deck arch bridge that’s widely viewed as the most ornamented and grand bridge in
                    Paris. It crosses over the Seine River and connects the Champs-Élysées quarter with Les Invalides and
                    the Eiffel Tower.
